Website to help people volunteer and find volunteers.
 On the homepage, you can sign up for the kind of volunteering you want to do.
 Then, on another page, you can search for volunteers in a specific subject.
 The idea of the project is really great, helpful, and useful - especially in times of war. 
The functionality looks good and seems to be working well.
 Styling could be slightly cleaner.
 Theres some text overlapping the flag background, which makes it harder to read.
 Also, the general positioning of elements can be enhanced by giving each form a bit more space.
 Maybe also consider adding a nice header - not just a paragraph right away with a lot of text.
 When you submit a form, it would be good to show the user a message to confirm whether their action was successful or unsuccessful.
 Also, on the "Go to Data" page, perhaps a better name for it could be "Search for Volunteers". 
When searching for volunteers and not getting any results, maybe you can show a message like "Sorry, there are no volunteers available at this time in this area for this subject". 
Now, onto the code. First of all, I appreciate the structure of the server.
 Routes, Controllers, and Models are well-done. 
Serving your frontend from the public folder is also great.
Fantastic job!
